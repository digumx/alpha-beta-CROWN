# Example of verifying an ONNX model with VNNLIB general specifications
model:
  # Assuming you have cloned the vnncomp2021 repository: https://github.com/stanleybak/vnncomp2021
  onnx_path: mnist_relu_9_200.onnx
specification:
  # VNNLIB file specification.
  vnnlib_path: mnist-relu-9-200/prop_1_0.015.vnnlib
solver:
  batch_size: 2048  # Number of subdomains to compute in parallel in bound solver. Decrease if you run out of memory.
